üå± IoT Hydroponic Nutrient Control System

This project was developed as part of the Service Learning Program for the Data Communication course at Petra Christian University. 
It aims to help hydroponic farmers‚Äîspecifically at Alam Sari Petra, Surabaya to automatically monitor and control the nutrient levels 
in hydroponic systems using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

üöÄ Project Objectives

1. Implement an automatic system to monitor and adjust nutrient levels in a hydroponic setup.
2. Simplify plant maintenance by reducing manual intervention.
3. Provide real-time data monitoring for better plant growth control.
4. Promote awareness of IoT applications in sustainable agriculture (urban farming).

üß† System Overview

This system uses the Deep Flow Technique (DFT) method, where nutrient-rich water continuously circulates through the roots of plants. 
To maintain stable nutrient levels, the system integrates the following components:

1. TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Sensor to measure nutrient concentration in the water.
2. ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller to process sensor data and control the pump.
3. Peristaltic Pump to add nutrient solution when the level drops below a threshold.
4. Relay Module to switch the pump on and off.
5. WiFi Connectivity for remote monitoring and data transmission.

When the TDS value falls below 1200 ppm, the microcontroller activates the relay to power the pump, adding nutrient solution until the optimal level is reached.

üåç Impact and Sustainability

This system was implemented at Alam Sari Petra, an educational urban farming park in Surabaya.
The project contributes by:

1. Helping staff maintain nutrient balance automatically.
2. Serving as an educational tool for visitors to learn about IoT in agriculture.
3. Being easily adaptable to other hydroponic systems.
